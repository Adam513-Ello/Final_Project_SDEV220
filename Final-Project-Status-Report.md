## ***In-Progress Tasks***

*September 10, 2024*
* Autumn started developing the class tkinter codes for the program

*September 15, 2024*
* Britt began drafting rewards system in which she created the opening screen of the app, which includes interactive buttons that highlights as yellow when clicked and takes user to a new window. Interactive buttons will open windows that will do the following:
  *  New Member: Begin the process of obtaining customer info, point balance, and redeeming points.
  *  Existing Member: Login authentication which then will show user profile, point balance, and transaction history
  *  Exit: Close out the program

* Britt began developing code for the new member registration window, which asks for user first and last name
* Britt began developing code for Existing Member Login window, which shows reward balance, past purchases, item to purchase and the points earned if purchased, and rewards that can be redeemed along with how many points needed to redeem them. She also coded feedback messages for successful and failed reward redemptions.
